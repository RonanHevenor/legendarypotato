# Legendary Potato: Rise of the Clankers

A story-driven action game where humanity fights back against AI-generated mechanical invaders known as "Clankers".

## Story

In a near-future world, artificial intelligence has turned against its creators. Mechanical robots called "Clankers" have overrun the cities, and humanity's last hope is a lone survivor fighting through waves of increasingly dangerous mechanical enemies.

Your mission: Battle through 5 levels of clanker invasion, from basic scout patrols to heavily armored command units. Each enemy is uniquely generated by AI, creating endless variety in your struggle for survival.

## Features

- **AI-Generated Clankers**: Every mechanical enemy is uniquely created using AI, with different appearances and combat styles
- **Story Progression**: 5 levels of increasing difficulty with narrative progression
- **Dynamic Combat**: Real-time battles with health, attacks, and projectile weapons
- **Procedural Levels**: Explore dynamically generated rooms as you advance
- **Score System**: Earn points for defeating enemies and surviving longer
- **Game Over & Restart**: Proper death mechanics with restart functionality

## Enemy Types

- **Scout Clankers**: Fast, lightly armed reconnaissance units (60 HP, 15 DMG)
- **Combat Clankers**: Balanced fighters with projectile weapons (100 HP, 25 DMG)
- **Heavy Clankers**: Slow but powerful armored assault units (200 HP, 40 DMG)
- **Repair Clankers**: Support units that maintain other clankers (80 HP, 10 DMG)

## Quick Start

1. Open the project in Godot 4.0+
2. Run the main scene (`scenes/levels/room_01.tscn`)
3. Use arrow keys to move, spacebar to attack
4. Defeat all enemies in a level to progress
5. Survive as long as possible against the clanker invasion!

## AI Clanker Generation

The game features an integrated AI clanker generator that:

- Uses OpenRouter API with GPT models (optional)
- Generates mechanical robot ASCII art
- Creates unique combat behaviors for each clanker type
- Works with mock data when dependencies aren't available
- Costs ~$0.01-0.02 per clanker when using real AI

## Requirements

- Godot 4.0+
- Python 3.8+ (optional, for AI generation - works with mock data if not available)

## Current Status

The game runs with mock AI-generated clankers! The AI generation system works but currently uses mock data since httpx dependencies aren't installed.

To enable real AI generation:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install httpx`
2. Add OpenRouter API key to `.env` file
3. The system will automatically use real AI generation

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys/WASD**: Move character
- **Space**: Attack nearby enemies
- **R**: Restart after game over

## Game Mechanics

- **Health System**: Player has 100 HP, enemies have varying health based on type
- **Combat**: Melee attacks with cooldown, some enemies use projectiles
- **Level Progression**: Defeat all enemies in a level to advance
- **Score**: Earn points for each enemy defeated
- **Story**: Narrative text explains each level's challenges
